# Mirroring-a-random-function-in-python-using-Machine-Learning
Think of a random number between 0 to 9. What is the probability of you choosing that number. 1/10 right. Or is it? 

1. How can a machine produce numbers randomly, since it follows procedures for all its operations?
2. Does it produce all numbers with equal frequencies or does it have a preference i.e. does machine have a favorite number that it keeps on producing more than the other numbers?
3. Does the machine produce random number in a very abstract pattern that we are not able to visualize?
4. 'IF' a machine is baised towards a/some particular number(s) that it keeps on producing it at a higher frequency than the other numbers, are other machines also baised towards that number, or do they have a/some different favorite number(s)? 
And most importantly
5. Can we make a machine learning projecgt that will learn from the data of random numbers previously generated by the machine and predict the next random number that the machine is going to produce? 
6. How efficient is our random number predictor or random mirror(because it mirrors the original random functions) in predicting the next possible number that will be generated by the random functions in python?

The idea behind this project is, although the random functions in python may seem random at first their may be a hidden pattern that we are not able to see yet. And since I am a machine learning beginner, I want to put machine learning concepts to work on all kinds of things that might seem a little bit weird. Machine learning python packages provide us with functions that find pattern in data and I am going to throw an examination for those function to see if they can find a pattern in randomness.

Things I did :

1. Produced dataset : 
The function random_number_generator() generates one lakh random numbers between zero to nine arranged in 100 rows with each row containing 1000 numbers and all this data is stored in a file named dataset.txt. 
I made 5 of these files with 1 lakh numbers in each. Hope thats enough. This is the dataset that will be fed to the machine learning model as it contains the order or pattern in which the numbers are being produced by the machine.

2. Sorted the dataset: 
Sorted each line individually in the dataset files using the Sorted_Dataset_Producer.py. These files help count the number of occurences of each number in each 1000 random numbers produced.  

3. Frequency count:
The sorted dataset files were then input to Number_Frequency_Finder.py, which essentially parses through each line in the datasets(100 lines in each of the 5 dataset files) and counts the frequency of each number in that line. The frequency of each number in every line is written in the below mentioned manner.
Line0 : (0,82)(1,85)(2,98)(3,98)(4,115)(5,96)(6,124)(7,90)(8,109)(9,103)

4. Generated a scatter plot:

<br/>
The plot above has the digits 0-9 on the X-axis and the Y-axis shows the frequency of each number in a single dataset file. Since there are 100 lines, each point representing the frequency of that digit in a particular line. But now I think this was not of much use.
