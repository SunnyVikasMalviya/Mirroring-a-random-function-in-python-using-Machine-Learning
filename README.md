# Mirroring-a-random-function-in-python-using-Machine-Learning
Think of a random number between 0 to 9. What is the probability of you choosing that number. 1/10 right. Or is it? 

1. How can a machine produce number randomly, since it is follows procedures for all its operations?
2. Does it produce numbers with equal frequencies or does it have a preference i.e. does machine have a favorite number that it keeps producing?
3. Does the machine produce random number in a very abstract pattern that humans are not able to visualize?
4. 'IF' a machine is baised towards a/some particular number(s) that it keeps producing it at a higher frequency then the other numbers, are other machines also baised towards that number, or do they have a/some different favorite number(s)? 
And most importantly
5. Can we make a project that will predict the next random number that the machine will produce? 

The idea behind this project is that although the random functions may seem random at first their may be a hidden pattern that we humans are not able to see. And since I am a machine learning beginner, I want to put machine to work on a things that might seem a little bit weird. Machine learning python packages provide us with functions that find pattern in data and I am going to throw an examination for those function to see if they can find a pattern in randomness.

Things I did :

1. Produced dataset : 
The function random_number_generator() generates one lakh random numbers between \
zero to nine arranged in 100 rows with each row containing 1000 numbers and all \
this data is stored in a file named dataset.txt. 
I made 5 files with 1 lakh numbers in each. Hope thats enough.

2.
